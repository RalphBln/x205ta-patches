Once you compiled the kernel with these patches applied, enable BFQ at boot with:
echo "ACTION==\"add|change\", KERNEL==\"mmcblk1\", ATTR{queue/scheduler}=\"bfq\"" | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60-scheduler.rules

or for the duration of the session (until reboot) with:
echo bfq | sudo tee /sys/block/mmcblk1/queue/scheduler
